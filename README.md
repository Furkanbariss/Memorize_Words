## Localization

To add support for a new language:

1. Create a new `values-[language_code]` folder in `app/src/main/res/`
2. Add a `strings.xml` file with translated strings
3. Update the `AppLanguage` enum in `LanguageManager.kt`
4. Add the language display name to the `getLanguageDisplayName` function

Example for adding German support:
```kotlin
enum class AppLanguage(val code: String, val displayName: String) {
    // ... existing languages
    GERMAN("de", "Deutsch")
}
```
